<p align="justify" style="font-size:25px">West Indies continued to go from strength to strength even in the absence of regular skipper Shai Hope and completed a convincing 3-0 whitewash over the UAE with a four-wicket win in the third and final ODI. At the core of this victory were Kevin Sinclair's four-wicket haul and Alick Athanaze's blazing fifty on debut.

UAE, opting to bat, started well but suffered a dramatic collapse, going from a promising position of 142/2 to being bowled out for a mere 184 runs in 36.1 overs. Their last eight wickets fell for just 42 runs. Kevin Sinclair emerged as the star performer for the visiting West Indies team, claiming figures of 4 for 24 while playing for the first time in the series.

Initially, the match appeared to be in UAE's favor when Vriitya Aravind and Muhammad Waseem were at the crease, building a solid partnership. However, Waseem's dismissal to Raymon Reifer disrupted the team's momentum. Aravind then formed another partnership with Rameez, but their fortunes changed with the introduction of Sinclair.West Indies continued to go from strength to strength even in the absence of regular skipper Shai Hope and completed a convincing 3-0 whitewash over the UAE with a four-wicket win in the third and final ODI.
